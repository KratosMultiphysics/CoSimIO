# Tutorial for integrating the CoSimIO

This folder contains step-by-step instructions on how to integrate the CoSimIO into a solver. Since the CoSimIO is independent of Kratos, this can be done completely standalone.


It is recommended to first take a look at the provided [examples](../examples)






After the integration is done


Which type of CoSimulation is desired?

The _CoSimIO_ offers basically two ways of performing CoSimulation:
- "Classical" way of CoSimulation:


- Giving full control to Kratos & CoSimulationApplication
